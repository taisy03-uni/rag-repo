The prosecution case was that the coded notes related to a previous police search operation in 2015 which had resulted in an arrest and prosecution of Kevin Nolan for possession of firearms, ammunition and explosives. Nolan had been sentenced in 2017. The prosecution contended that the interpretation of the code contained within the notes and the sequence of events described represented a debriefing exercise conducted by dissident republicans in respect of that seizure of weapons and explosives. This was designed to provide practical assistance to a person committing or preparing acts of terrorism in the future by providing information as to where the munitions and explosives had been recovered from, the fact that there had allegedly been MI5 surveillance at a specified location, and the making of decisions as to where to store munitions or explosives in the future and who could or could not be trusted to store such material.</p>

Her evidence at trial was that the notes related to papers which were put through her letterbox anonymously some time shortly before Christmas 2017. She wrote on issues relating to policing and to approaches made by MI5 to people and on occasions she would receive materials anonymously in relation to such issues. She considered that the papers were sent to her in connection with this work. She reviewed the papers but, apart from a section that detailed approaches by &#8220;Big Eyes&#8221; (which she took to mean MI5) approaching a ciphered individual both in an airport and when he returned home, she could not make much sense of them. She did not know who the ciphered persons in the papers were. She stated that at the time she received the papers she had concluded that they were sent to her as their utility was spent, but she could not recall now why she had formed that opinion. Her evidence was that she believed that she had the papers in connection with her lawful writings and did not have reason to suspect that the papers (written in code) would be of use to anyone at the time that she received them. In seeking to maintain the confidential nature of the information and the source of the information she copied the papers provided in her own hand and retained her copy. The original papers were then disposed of.</p>

Any currency in the information contained in the notes was considered by the Defendant to have long since dissipated. The Defendant did not think that the information in the notes, at the time at which she received them, would be of any future use to anyone in any sinister way. Any &#8216;usefulness&#8217; or utility that the information might once have had (which utility is not accepted) had been spent.

The obvious meaning of that portion of the defence statement is that she knew well that the notes related to the arms find in 2015 and the conviction of Mr Nolan in 2017 but thought that the information was no longer of use or value. That is definitively not the case which she made in her oral evidence during which she said that she made &#8216;a bit of sense&#8217; of parts like &#8216;Big Eyes&#8217; but that it was otherwise meaningless.</p>

He had read the first two sentences as being connected. They were not. The first sentence provided a temporal framework for when the appellant received the notes. The second sentence indicated the appellant&#8217;s attitude to the notes when she received them. The judge had wrongly interpreted these sentences as saying that: &#8220;These original notes were forwarded to the Defendant some considerable time after the events giving rise to Kevin Nolan&#8217;s conviction and were forwarded after Kevin Nolan was sentenced, therefore any currency in the information contained in the notes was considered by the Defendant to have long since dissipated&#8221;.

Rather it had several other ingredients. There is no sustainable challenge to any of these. The judge concluded that the appellant&#8217;s account was directly contradicted by all the evidence. He identified no evidence supporting it. These are powerful, uncompromising findings. They are plainly harmonious with the evidence adduced. They betray no error of law.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[107] Furthermore, it is to be noted that the judge&#8217;s diagnosis of a direct contradiction of the appellant&#8217;s account by the evidence included what followed. The five particulars then formulated, therefore, were not designed to be exhaustive. It is clear to this court from its careful review of the transcribed evidence, particularly that of the appellant, that the judge could have amplified his list. In particular, and inexhaustively, the judge could readily have added that the appellant&#8217;s claim that the notes allegedly received by her were never going to be of any journalistic value because of (a) their lack of intelligibility and (b) the anonymity factor was manifestly irreconcilable with her assertions that she nonetheless devoted a full week to the exercise of deciphering them and struggled to comprehend much of their meaning. The judge could also have made the same assessment of the appellant&#8217;s claim that she copied the content of the notes into her own handwriting for the purpose of protecting the source &#8211; an unidentified person - and, further, one whose lack of identity, on her case, rendered the content journalistically useless. The contradiction is unmistakeable. Equally striking is the appellant&#8217;s failure to adduce evidence of comparable writing conduct &#8211; which, on her case, was available. The judge could also have added that the appellant&#8217;s explanation of her failure to record the relevant information on her laptop (see para [72] above) was incongruous and, hence, unbelievable&#8221;.</p>

The apparent explanation provided in para 4(n) put to her by the judge was that she knew that they were obsolete because it was a considerable time after Nolan&#8217;s conviction and sentence. In evidence, she was unable to provide any other explanation of how she knew that &#8220;the currency in the information&#8221; had &#8220;long since dissipated&#8221;. This highlights the point that the interpretation of para 4(n) was simply one aspect of the evidence relevant to the appellant&#8217;s credibility. It was part of the overall assessment of that credibility. Of the four general categories of case set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Tweed</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Thain</span>, it falls most obviously within category 3 &#8211; ie a finding which can only be challenged if the judge &#8220;misdirected himself in law or if he has misunderstood or misused the facts and may thereby have reached a wrong conclusion&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">As to (2), Mr Hutton relied upon the directions to be given in relation to an alleged confession by an accused to the effect that it may only be relied upon if the jury is sure that what was said amounts to a confession &#8211; see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">R v B</span> [2009] EWCA Crim 2113. By analogy, he argued that an interpretation of para 4(n) adverse to the appellant could only be relied upon if the judge was sure that that was the only proper interpretation to put upon what was said. This is not, however, an analogous case to a confession. There is no requirement or threshold to be met before the statement made can be relied upon. The defence statement was put in evidence (by the defence &#8211; as was common ground). Statements made by or on behalf of the appellant in the defence statement can be relied upon if it is relevant to do so and, in particular, where they may differ from what is said in oral evidence. Whilst the accused&#8217;s guilt has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, that does not mean that each evidential matter relied upon has to be proved to that standard.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider that this is therefore a case in which the appellant has to show a misdirection in law or that a plainly wrong or perverse conclusion has been reached. It is not suggested that there was any misdirection other than in reaching what is said to be an erroneous conclusion as to what para 4(n) means. As to perversity, it was submitted that the judge&#8217;s interpretation was contrary to the ordinary meaning of the words used and was plainly wrong.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not consider the judge&#8217;s interpretation to be in any way perverse. The natural inference to be drawn from the inclusion of the first and second sentences of para 4(n) next to each other in the same numbered paragraph is that they are connected. One does not need the inclusion of the word &#8220;therefore&#8221; for such a connection to be made. As such, the reason for the appellant&#8217;s conclusion in the second sentence that the currency of the information in the notes had long since dissipated is apparently that stated in the first sentence &#8211; ie that it was a considerable time after the Nolan conviction and sentence. No other reason is given in the defence statement for drawing that conclusion. Nor was any other reason given in oral evidence. The appellant&#8217;s evidence was that she could not recall why she had formed that opinion.</p>

Further cogent reasons for so concluding are set out in para 43 of the judgment, as confirmed in and added to by para 107 of the Court of Appeal&#8217;s judgment.</p>

Moreover, that finding of fact has been upheld by the Court of Appeal and so this is an appeal against concurrent findings of fact. It is only in very rare cases that it will be appropriate for this court to take the exceptional step of disturbing concurrent findings of fact. As stated by Lord Steyn in <span style="font-style:italic">Smith New Court Securities Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd</span> [1997] AC 254, 275:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;While the jurisdiction of the House is not in doubt, it is most reluctant to disturb concurrent findings of fact. There are two reasons for this approach. First, the prime function of the House of Lords is to review questions of law of general public importance. That function it cannot properly discharge if it often has to hear appeals on pure fact&#8230; Secondly, in the case of concurrent findings of fact, the House is confronted with the combined views of the first instance judge and the Court of Appeal. A suggestion that the House can be expected to take a different view on concurrent findings <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT">of fact </span>generally gives rise to an initial sense of disbelief.&#8221;</p>

The reasons for that practice include that: (i) the reliability of the trial judge&#8217;s findings will already have been subjected to careful review by a properly constituted and experienced court of appeal; (ii) where two courts (one of them appellate) have agreed upon a finding of fact, it is inherently unlikely that a second appellate court will be well-placed to disagree with both of them with any degree of confidence; (iii) the parties are entitled to expect a reasonable degree of finality in litigation and (iv) the minute examination of the detailed evidence underlying findings of fact is an expensive and time-consuming process &#8211; see <span style="font-style:italic">Sancus Financial Holdings Ltd v Holm (Practice Note) </span>[2022] UKPC 41; [2022] 1 WLR 5181, para 5.</p>
