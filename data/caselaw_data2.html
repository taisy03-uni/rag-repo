	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The High Court is occasionally called upon to decide whether life-sustaining treatment being given in hospitals to gravely ill children should be continued or withdrawn. The proceedings are often urgent, and frequently come to an end when the child dies, either because the court grants a declaration that it is in the child&#8217;s best interests that life-sustaining treatment should be withdrawn, or because the child dies naturally despite having received life-sustaining treatment before the court&#8217;s decision can be made. The question is always: what is in the child&#8217;s best interests? There is sometimes disagreement, typically between parents and clinicians, but sometimes between clinicians themselves, as to whether life support should continue to be provided. Those disagreements can become emotionally charged. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the proceedings in court are designed to resolve such disagreements, the effect of their commencement and of any public hearing is typically to expand the dispute into the public domain, because of reporting by the press, radio and television and through dissemination on social media.  At that point the experience of recent cases is that a disagreement about the child&#8217;s best interests can turn into an uncontrolled furore in the public arena, in which some of the protagonists resort to abuse directed at members of the clinical team treating the child, for example in the form of vilification on social media, or by shouting abuse at staff outside the hospital concerned. This can amount to harassment of the staff affected, leading to distress, disillusionment, psychological illness, demotivation and even withdrawal from that vital work.  It can also have an adverse effect upon the quality of the treatment being given to the sick child.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The judges of the Family Division, to whom these decisions are assigned, have developed a practice of seeking to limit this risk by issuing injunctions at the outset of the proceedings which prohibit anyone from revealing the identity of the clinical team and the hospital where the child is being treated, and sometimes also the identity of the child, their family, the relevant NHS trust, and other individuals with an involvement in the child&#8217;s treatment and care. Typically the parents themselves are among those bound by the injunction. Such injunctions have been described as reporting restriction orders, but unlike reporting restriction orders as ordinarily understood, the effect of the injunctions is not solely or primarily (if at all) to restrict the reporting of information which has emerged in open court. Their effect is to prevent the identification of persons and institutions involved in the treatment and care of the child in question, whether or not those persons and institutions have been mentioned in court, and whether or not the court proceedings were held in public. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The issues which have led to this appeal are not principally concerned with the original granting of the injunctions, which in the two cases heard together on this appeal was effectively unopposed. Nor are they concerned with the effect of the injunctions while the proceedings remain active. Rather they arise from the continuation of the injunctions after the proceedings have concluded. Under the current practice in the Family Division, at least as exemplified by the cases under appeal, an injunction of indefinite duration is granted at the outset of the proceedings, so that it continues to inhibit disclosure until someone successfully applies for its variation or discharge.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In the two cases under appeal the parents of the children concerned applied, after the children had died, to be released from the restrictions imposed by the relevant injunction. They wished to tell their story about what had happened to them and their child, both in hospital and in court, and in doing so to be free to name and to criticise members of the clinical team caring for their child. They said that the injunction was an illegitimate restriction of their freedom of speech. The NHS trusts concerned resisted the parents&#8217; applications, on the primary ground that making public the names of the treating clinicians would create an unacceptable risk of an invasion of their rights to private life, by exposing them to harassment and abuse of the type described above.</p>

	  <num style="font-size:13pt">6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The courts below reached opposite conclusions about the parents&#8217; applications. At first instance, the President of the Family Division agreed with the trusts that the injunctions should not be discharged: [2021] EWHC 1699 (Fam); [2022] Fam 180. The Court of Appeal disagreed, and discharged the injunctions: [2023] EWCA Civ 331; [2023] Fam 287. Its order has been stayed pending the outcome of this appeal. While at first sight this disagreement might look like different judges taking different views about where the balance lay between the competing rights to freedom of expression and to a private life of the parents and the clinical team respectively, careful inspection of their reasoning reveals significant differences between them as to the principles to be applied. Furthermore, although both the courts below agreed that the court had jurisdiction (in the sense of power) to grant the injunctions and to continue them after the proceedings had concluded, the parents maintain a challenge to the existence of that jurisdiction, in particular in cases like the present where the injunctions were granted, and maintained in force after the proceedings had concluded, on the application of the trusts themselves, rather than by the clinicians thereby protected.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Resolution of those issues has led this court into the need to review from first principles the practice of the making and continuation of injunctions of this kind. In some respects the court has looked beyond the arguments originally advanced by the parties in their written cases, but not without inviting submissions on those wider concerns. This is in particular because, after the hearings in the courts below and the preparation of the parties&#8217; written cases, this court conducted a fundamental review of the court&#8217;s power to grant injunctive relief, albeit largely outside the human rights context, in <span style="font-style:italic">Wolverhampton City Council v London Gypsies and Travellers </span>[2023] UKSC 47; [2024] AC 983 (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Wolverhampton</span>&#8221;). The principles which govern the grant and continuation of injunctions apply to all Divisions of the High Court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Zainab Abbasi was born in 2013 with a rare and profoundly disabling neurodegenerative disease, to which was added lung damage as the result of her contracting swine flu in 2016. For most of her life she was treated in hospital under a mainly palliative treatment plan delivered by Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (&#8220;the Newcastle Trust&#8221;). Both of Zainab&#8217;s parents are medically qualified, and they disagreed with the restriction in Zainab&#8217;s care plan to palliative care, considering that more active care would be appropriate. The parents also became increasingly critical of the overall care regime under which the hospital&#8217;s paediatric intensive care unit operated and the way in which care was delivered to their daughter by individual staff members. Matters deteriorated to the extent that the hospital sought to prohibit Zainab&#8217;s father from attending the ward and, when he did so, the police were called and he was forcibly removed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The Newcastle Trust issued proceedings in the Family Division in August 2019.  The respondents were Zainab herself, by her CAFCASS guardian, and her parents. All the parties&#8217; names were anonymised from the outset. The Trust sought a declaration that it was in Zainab&#8217;s best interests that life-sustaining treatment should be withdrawn. It also sought an injunction to prevent the identification of persons and institutions involved in Zainab&#8217;s treatment until the proceedings had been concluded, pointing to recent cases of a similar nature which had attracted interest from campaigning groups and from individuals who behaved badly during the proceedings, with social media threats to medical and legal professionals involved. The Trust stated that if something similar happened, it would adversely affect not only the care provided to Zainab but also the care provided to other children in the hospital. On 6 September 2019, at a hearing in private at which the Trust, Zainab&#8217;s parents, Zainab&#8217;s CAFCASS guardian and the Press Association were represented (having been given notice of the application), case management directions were given by MacDonald J for a full hearing on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>and 20 September 2019.

It based its application on article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (&#8220;the Convention&#8221;), which protects the right to respect for private and family life, the home and correspondence. In that regard, the Trust relied on the article 8 rights of the persons in relation to whom the order was sought. On 12 September 2019 Lieven J issued an injunction, the main terms of which we set out below. The order was made without opposition following a public hearing at which the Trust, Zainab&#8217;s CAFCASS guardian and the Press Association were represented. </p>

The Trust then sought an order preventing the publication of any material which might identify those who had cared for, or were at the time caring for, Isaiah or his mother, the authors of second opinions, and the clinicians with whom the Trust had liaised over a possible transfer of Isaiah to another hospital. The application was advanced on the basis that the Trust was concerned for the welfare of the clinicians who formed the subject of the proposed order, were they to be identified. That, it was said, could lead to the care provided to Isaiah and other patients being compromised, as well as an intrusion into the privacy of the individuals concerned.

Zainab&#8217;s mother, Dr Aliya Abbasi, is also a doctor. In the father&#8217;s statement, he noted that end of life care was a sensitive area which had given rise to public concern and controversy. Arguments had been made for a reform of the law. It was in the public interest for the public to know the facts. There were lessons to be learned from Zainab&#8217;s case, for the public and for the medical profession. He and his wife had observed unprofessional and unethical behaviour by some of their medical colleagues. Some of the clinicians had been reluctant to treat Zainab&#8217;s respiratory disorder, although it was treatable, because of her underlying neuro-degenerative condition. They had failed to provide optimal care. To substantiate their concerns, the Abbasis needed to be able to name the individual clinicians they believed to be responsible. Zainab&#8217;s father also wished to publicise an audio-recording of his and his wife&#8217;s meeting with the clinical team, at which clinicians had attempted to pressurise them into agreeing to a withdrawal of life support. They also wished to be able to respond to allegations made against them by clinicians which had been reported in the media, by placing matters in context and explaining the background difficulties between certain clinicians and themselves. Zainab&#8217;s father emphasised that he and his wife only wanted to voice concerns about the professional conduct of certain clinicians involved in Zainab&#8217;s treatment.

Some members of the public had staged protests outside the hospitals, and in some instances had allegedly made threats to hospital staff. This caused staff to suffer anxiety and distress, and was liable to disrupt the quality of care provided to patients. We note that the evidence produced in relation to the Gard and Evans cases concerned events during the children&#8217;s lifetimes, while the hospitals were seeking declarations that life-sustaining treatment could be withdrawn, and in circumstances where it was known where the children were being treated. The statements also expressed concern that doctors and nurses might be discouraged from entering specialisms where there was a particular risk of exposure to the media if there was no restriction on reporting in difficult cases.</p>

The Royal College of Nursing, the British Medical Association, the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the Paediatric Critical Care Society took part in the appeal as interveners (as they have also taken part in the present appeal). Following a hearing before Lord Burnett of Maldon LCJ, King and Carr LJJ in November 2022, the judgment of the court was handed down at the end of March 2023, allowing the appeals and discharging the injunctions.

There could be no doubt that it had jurisdiction to make, continue, vary or discharge injunctions restraining publicity during proceedings of this kind, as well as after their conclusion.

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is important to start the analysis of injunctions of the present kind by focusing upon the type of proceedings in which these orders come to be made. In proceedings of this kind the High Court is exercising its inherent jurisdiction as parens patriae, that is, it is performing the Crown&#8217;s residual function of protecting those who stand in need of protection. The court&#8217;s primary responsibility in exercising that jurisdiction in such cases is to decide which among available alternatives in medical treatment will serve the best interests of the child concerned. It is not acting simply as an adjudicator between the competing rights and obligations of the parties in an essentially adversarial contest between them. As Viscount Haldane LC explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Scott </span>[1913] AC 417, 437, in relation to the parens patriae jurisdiction over wards of court and incapacitated adults:</p>

Its jurisdiction is in this respect parental and administrative, and the disposal of controverted questions is an incident only in the jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in">Those observations are equally applicable where the child is not a ward of court, but is otherwise under the court&#8217;s protection exercising its parens patriae powers: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">In re M and N (Minors) (Wardship: Publication of Information) </span>[1990] Fam 211, 223.   </p>

But there are of course parties to the proceedings. They are commenced because someone (usually the hospital entity, here two NHS trusts) has brought the need for a decision as to the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment to the attention of the court. The respondents are normally the parents or guardian of the child, any other person who has an interest in or relationship to the child, and the child, represented by a guardian who is independent of both the trust and the parents with whom the trust may be in dispute. </p>

And if there are in reality just two choices, between continuing with or ending life support, there will frequently be both the appearance and the reality of an adversarial contest between the proponents of those two alternatives.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Nonetheless, the court is being called upon to intervene in the care of the child by another entity, the trust, already charged with and exercising that care. The court&#8217;s task is to decide how that care should be discharged in the best interests of the child. In these circumstances, the question whether or not to grant an injunction at the outset of the proceedings is bound to be affected by the natural desire of the court to minimise the risk of collateral damage which publicity about the proceedings may cause to the medical care being provided by the trust; all the more so if that damage is threatened to be caused by unlawful activity in the form of abuse and harassment by persons as yet unknown. It is natural for the trust as applicant to wish to alert the court to that risk, both because it may adversely affect its care for the child and for other children in its care with similar needs, and also because as employer of the staff involved it wishes them to be protected against the risk of harm arising from the publicity which the proceedings may otherwise attract.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">A second important aspect of the context is that the proceedings generally have to be conducted with some urgency. There may be a limited time in which to make a choice between different treatment regimes. The child may be in pain or distress which the trust is struggling to relieve. But there may be a need for intense preparation of evidence (including medical opinion) before a hearing, to enable the court to make an informed choice. The point of this aspect of the context is that the parents in this appeal were critical of the use of evidence about the risks of abuse and harassment drawn from earlier cases, rather than evidence concerning the particular factual circumstances of the case before the court. But it is for cautious consideration to what extent the parties can be expected to devote significant time and effort to the preparation of evidence and submissions about an injunction, when struggling to prepare for the determination of the life or death question which the proceedings have been issued to have speedily resolved. We return to this below.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The urgency which attends the commencement and hearing of the proceedings is matched by the suddenness of their likely end, generally upon the death of the child. This may occur at any time if the child dies before the court has given its decision, and is likely to occur shortly after a decision that life support should be withdrawn, if (in the absence of an appeal) the child&#8217;s death follows as the natural consequence. But if an injunction has been granted which is not by its own terms expressed to cease to have effect when the proceedings end, or after a specified period thereafter, the consequence is that a permanent restriction of disclosure remains in place, detached from the proceedings to which it was ancillary as a mechanism for avoiding collateral damage, and from the treatment which it was designed, at least in part, to protect from the deleterious effects of publicity. Furthermore, after the child has died, parens patriae powers can no longer be exercised. If the injunction is to be continued, it must be on some other basis. And at that stage, if not earlier, it may well be reasonable to expect any application for the continuation of the order to be supported by evidence concerned specifically with the circumstances of the case before the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Something more can usefully be said about the harm typically said to be threatened by publicity being given to the proceedings, if the clinicians involved in the underlying care are not anonymised. The first point is that, to the extent that the harm consists of abuse directed at members of the clinical team treating the child, or other clinicians involved in giving advice about treatment, it will generally be impossible to know in advance which members of the public will be tempted into such conduct, and impossible to know even after the event, where the abuse takes the form of anonymous messages on social media. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">A second point to note is that the harm liable to be caused by such abuse may fall into a number of distinct legal categories. First, it may result in damage to the quality of the hospital&#8217;s care for the relevant child, and possibly others being cared for in the same unit. Such damage will be contrary to the interests and rights of the relevant child, and it may also be an interference with the hospital trust&#8217;s performance of its statutory functions. Secondly, the abuse may constitute an infringement of such rights as members of the clinical team have to be protected from such behaviour under the common law (eg of defamation, trespass or assault) and statute (eg under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997), and in accordance with their Convention rights. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is reasonable to infer that the risk of such harm is likely to decline over time, from the moment when the proceedings end. If the child dies before a decision has been issued or as a consequence of the court&#8217;s granting the declaration sought, then media and social media interest can generally be expected to decline, as there is no longer any prospect of saving the child&#8217;s life (it can equally be expected to decline if the court refuses to grant the declaration sought, or if, contrary to expectation, the withdrawal of life support does not result in the child&#8217;s death). Although the parents will continue to grieve, the emotional reaction of the general public is unlikely to be as strong, especially if publicity was restricted while the child was being treated. There was no evidence before the courts below, when dealing with the applications for the discharge of the orders, to suggest otherwise. By contrast, the effect of the restraint upon the parents&#8217; freedom of expression is likely to be much more enduring in its consequences. The sense of injustice engendered by being prohibited from speaking freely about the loss of their child may well be lifelong in its effect.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">A third point to note is that the harm which the child may suffer if the treatment provided is deleteriously affected by abuse of the clinical team, and the harm which the trust may suffer if its ability to care for the child, or for other children in its care, is deleteriously affected by such abuse, are both entirely consequential on harm suffered by the clinicians themselves. There is therefore an overlap between the child&#8217;s interests, the interest of the trust in preserving the anonymity of the clinicians so as to avoid the adverse impact which abuse of them would have upon its provision of care to its patients, and the interest of the clinicians in preserving their own anonymity, so as to avoid violations of their rights. That overlap has an important consequence: by protecting its own interest in the anonymity of the clinicians, the trust can also incidentally protect the clinicians&#8217; private lives; and, so long as the child continues to live, the court can do the same by protecting the interests of the child. The trust, and the court, can thus protect the private lives of the clinicians without necessarily concerning themselves directly with the clinicians&#8217; rights. The clinicians&#8217; rights can, of course, also be asserted directly, as we shall explain.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the orders bind individuals and organisations who are not themselves likely to commit any act which infringes the rights of others. For example, the child&#8217;s parents, and media outlets which may report the proceedings, are bound by the orders regardless of whether they are themselves likely to abuse or harass the clinicians involved in the care of the child. The absence of a cause of action against a defendant is not in itself an insuperable objection to the granting of an injunction, as was explained in the <span style="font-style:italic">Wolverhampton </span>case at paras 43-49 and 153. An analogy can be drawn, for example, with <span style="font-style:italic">Norwich Pharmacal </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Bankers Trust </span>orders (see respectively <span style="font-style:italic">Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs and Excise Comrs</span> [1974] AC 133 and <span style="font-style:italic">Bankers Trust Co v Shapira</span> [1980] 1 WLR 1274), and more particularly with internet blocking orders (see <span style="font-style:italic">Cartier International AG v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd </span>[2018] UKSC 28; [2018] 1 WLR 3259), discussed in <span style="font-style:italic">Wolverhampton </span>at paras 47-49 and 160-164. Like internet blocking orders, these injunctions can bind individuals, despite there being no cause of action against them, where that is the only effective way of protecting the interests which the order is designed to protect, whether those are the interests of the child, or the interests of the trusts in being able to perform their statutory functions without interference, or the interests of the clinical staff involved in the child&#8217;s treatment. </p>

For example, the Abbasi injunction prohibited the publication of any information which was likely to identify the four clinicians listed in the appendix to the order or where they lived, although the only hearings to have taken place in court concerned case management directions and the granting of the injunction. The Haastrup injunction prohibited the identification of the clinical staff involved in the care of Isaiah and his mother during her ante-natal care and labour, although the court proceedings were not concerned with her or Isaiah&#8217;s treatment at that time. It also prohibited the identification of any clinical, nursing or non-clinical staff involved in Isaiah&#8217;s care, regardless of whether such persons gave evidence or were named in the proceedings.</p>

They are also different in that they are made in proceedings that are usually held in private. In other words, unlike reporting restriction orders, they do not necessarily make inroads upon the open justice principle (a matter to which we will return). For all these reasons, it appears to us to be confusing and potentially misleading to describe these injunctions as reporting restriction orders.</p>

It will be necessary to consider at a later stage whether all of these purposes are legitimate reasons for issuing injunctions of this kind, and for maintaining them in force after the child has died; how they relate to questions of standing; and their weight when balanced against the competing rights of those, including the parents and the media, whose freedom of expression is restricted.</p>

It is also necessary to consider the contention that such orders are incompatible with the principle of open justice.

The injunctions were initially granted without opposition. At the stage when the question arose whether they should be discharged or new injunctions granted, following the children&#8217;s deaths, the President was not hearing an appeal against the grant of the injunctions at the outset of the proceedings, but proceeded on the assumption that jurisdiction to make such orders existed. He also considered that the court must have jurisdiction to continue or discharge injunctions which were currently in force, and that that jurisdiction had to be exercised in accordance with section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act, with the consequence that the court had to balance competing considerations under articles 8 and 10 of the Convention. The Court of Appeal considered that the court had inherent jurisdiction to grant the injunctions exercising its parens patriae powers. Its jurisdiction had to be exercised in accordance with section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act, so far as Convention rights were concerned. Having granted the orders, the court also had jurisdiction to consider whether to continue or discharge them, and again had to act in accordance with section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act.</p>

On behalf of the parents, it was submitted that, although the power conferred by section 37(1) of the Senior Courts Act is theoretically unlimited, it is only exercised in accordance with established principles.

The Court of Appeal substituted a contra mundum injunction in different terms, prohibiting (1) the publication of the name or address or otherwise identifying the child, her parents, the hospitals at which she was being or had been treated, or any natural person having had or continuing to have her care, (2) soliciting information relating to the child or her parents from the parents, the staff of the hospitals, or the persons having had or continuing to have the care of the child, or (3) publishing such information obtained from such persons. The court added a schedule naming the child and the parties.

The court had jurisdiction to grant such an injunction in the exercise of its parens patriae powers, if it was necessary for the protection of the child&#8217;s interests, including her welfare, her right to confidentiality and privacy, and her Convention rights (as distinct, so far as this ground of jurisdiction is concerned, from the protection of the clinicians, the hospital or the Trust, except in so far as that was necessary for the protection of the child&#8217;s interests). The prohibited information was within the scope of the injunction granted in <span style="font-style:italic">In re C</span>, apart from the inclusion of the Trust; but a prohibition on the identification of the Trust would also fall within the scope of the parens patriae jurisdiction if it was necessary to protect the child&#8217;s interests, as might well be the case (for example, if the identification of the Trust could lead to the identification of the hospital where the child was being treated).</p>

In the first place, it prohibited the disclosure of the names or personal details of all the clinical and non-clinical staff who had cared or continued to care for the child since his birth. That information was within the scope of the injunction granted in <span style="font-style:italic">In re C, </span>and the prohibition on its disclosure was within the court&#8217;s parens patriae jurisdiction, in order to protect the child&#8217;s right to confidentiality and privacy. For the same reason, there was jurisdiction to grant a similar injunction in respect of clinicians who had provided a second opinion or advice to King&#8217;s regarding the child&#8217;s diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and management. Such clinicians must have been provided in confidence with information about the child&#8217;s medical condition and treatment, which (as they can be taken to have known) the Trust itself held subject to a duty of confidence which it owed to the child. When it was disclosed to the external clinicians, their resultant duty of confidence was consequently owed to the child, as well as to the Trust. The same might well also apply to any clinicians with whom the Trust had communicated regarding a possible transfer of the child to another hospital.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand, in so far as the Haastrup injunction prohibited the disclosure of the names and details of the clinical staff involved in the care of the unborn child and his mother during her ante-natal care and labour, it could not be justified on the basis of a duty of confidentiality owed to the child: while the child was in utero, the clinicians stood in a confidential relationship only to his mother (and she was entitled to waive their duty of confidentiality). It is not obvious, and it has not been argued, that the child&#8217;s right to be protected against an invasion of privacy would extend to his mother&#8217;s pregnancy and labour. Whether there was jurisdiction to grant such an injunction on the basis that it was necessary to protect the welfare of the child, or to secure the administration of justice, would depend on whether the identification of the clinicians who had previously treated the mother was likely to have a significant impact on the continuing treatment of the child. That might well have been the position on the facts at the time when the injunction was granted, given the link between the negligence at the time of Isaiah&#8217;s birth and the events that followed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, in relation to the parens patriae jurisdiction, we should note a point arising in relation to the duration of the injunctions. As we have explained, an injunction granted under parens patriae powers can provide clinicians with anonymity, so as to prevent the harmful effects which publicity might have upon the care which they provide to the child. However, the jurisdiction is available only as long as the child is alive; and the risk of a social media furore, in cases of the present kind, may continue after the child&#8217;s death, at least for a time. There is therefore a risk that an injunction granted under the parens patriae jurisdiction may cease to provide the protection needed both by the trust, if there are other gravely ill children being treated by the same clinicians, and by the clinicians themselves, if the child dies during the course of the proceedings or within a short time of a decision approving the withdrawal of life support.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">That risk can be avoided by fixing the duration of the injunction so that it remains in force for a period of time after the end of the proceedings, which we refer to below as a cooling-off period. That will allow time for the trust to seek a continuation of the injunction, if that is necessary to prevent interference with its ability to treat its patients. The cooling-off period will also provide time for the clinicians themselves to seek an injunction on the basis of their own right to privacy, if they have not already done so, and if an order continues to be necessary. The extension of the original injunction into a cooling-off period can be justified under the <span style="font-style:italic">Broadmoor </span>jurisdiction discussed below (ie the jurisdiction established in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Broadmoor Special Hospital Authority v Robinson </span>[2000] QB 775) on the basis that it is necessary in order to enable the trust to fulfil its responsibilities towards the other gravely ill children under its care. The extension of the injunction can also be justified on an equitable basis, as the original order has the practical effect of protecting the interests of the clinicians, and time should therefore be allowed for them to take steps for their continued protection before the existing protection is withdrawn. The cooling-off period should accordingly be of sufficient duration to enable the trust to apply for a continuation of the injunction, and to enable the clinicians to join the proceedings if they consider that to be necessary.  </p>

A significant authority in this context is the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Broadmoor</span>. The defendant in the proceedings had been convicted of manslaughter and was a patient in a special hospital. He wrote a book in which he described how he had killed his victim and his justification for doing so. He also identified other patients and gave details of their offences and mental states. The hospital authority obtained an ex parte injunction restraining him from distributing the book and ordering him to deliver up, and cause his printers to deliver up, all copies of it. That injunction was discharged on the defendant&#8217;s application, and the Court of Appeal (Lord Woolf MR, Morritt and Waller LJ) dismissed an appeal against that decision. However, a majority of the court upheld the existence of jurisdiction to grant an injunction on the application of the hospital authority where a defendant was interfering with the performance of its public responsibilities.</p>

Such proceedings normally have to be brought by or on behalf of those individuals themselves, since it is to them that the relevant duty is owed (<span style="font-style:italic">Fraser v Evans </span>[1969] 1 QB 349, 361). The position is different where, on the facts, the hospital authority can itself assert a relevant right, such as a right of confidence in respect of its own records, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Ashworth Hospital Authority v MGN Ltd </span>[2001] 1 WLR 515 (the Court of Appeal&#8217;s conclusion on this point was not challenged on the subsequent appeal to the House of Lords ([2002] UKHL 29; [2002] 1 WLR 2033). In addition, as Lord Woolf MR indicated in <span style="font-style:italic">Broadmoor </span>(para 70 above), it is possible for the hospital authority to bring a claim which has the effect of protecting its patients (or third parties) where it relies on the interference which the conduct of which complaint is made would have on the performance of its duties.</p>

Depending on the circumstances, proceedings may, for example, be brought to prevent defamation, trespass, breach of confidence, harassment contrary to the Protection of Harassment Act 1997, infringement of the processing regime established by the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and the Data Protection Act 2018, and misuse of private information and invasion of privacy. The latter cause of action may be particularly significant. It has developed in recent times, partly at least in order to secure rights relating to privacy in English law as required by article 8 of the Convention, while also giving effect to freedom of expression in accordance with article 10. </p>

The approach adopted in cases concerned with the disclosure of information, as explained in <span style="font-style:italic">ZXC v Bloomberg LP</span>, has been to ask in the first place whether the information in question is private. The answer has been held generally to depend on whether it is information in respect of which the claimant had a reasonable expectation of privacy. If the information is private, the next question is whether it has been used by the defendant in a way which constitutes an infringement of the claimant&#8217;s right to privacy. That may (and usually does) involve deciding whether the interference with the claimant&#8217;s privacy is justified by a competing interest, such as the defendant&#8217;s right to freedom of expression. In relation to all stages of the analysis, guidance can be found in a rapidly growing body of domestic legal precedent, as well as in developments in other jurisdictions which share our common law tradition, and in the jurisprudence of the European court. The courts have also recognised that the cause of action is not limited to the disclosure of private information, but extends to other forms of invasion of privacy, in such cases as <span style="font-style:italic">PJS v News Group Newspapers Ltd </span>[2016] UKSC 26; [2016] AC 1081 and <span style="font-style:italic">Khuja v Times Newspapers Ltd </span>[2017] UKSC 49; [2019] AC 161.

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The clinicians&#8217; cause of action in tort has to be asserted in a claim brought by the clinicians themselves. This may present practical difficulties in the context of a dispute over the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, as the clinicians may be under pressure enough in caring for the child at that critical stage without having to undertake all that is involved in the bringing of legal proceedings. However, that potential problem is capable of being overcome if the trust undertakes the necessary preparations, by agreement with the clinicians, and the clinicians&#8217; application for a quia timet injunction against disclosure of their identity, to protect their claim to protection from harassment or privacy in tort and under article 8, is joined to the proceedings brought by the trust under the parens patriae jurisdiction or the <span style="font-style:italic">Broadmoor </span>jurisdiction (or both). The clinicians&#8217; claim can then be advanced as part of the same proceedings. In practical terms, for the trust to support the bringing of the clinicians&#8217; claim in this way, and have their claim joined to its own, will normally be little more than a formality, as the trust&#8217;s case for the grant of an injunction is based on the same concern as the clinicians&#8217;: the apprehended risk that the clinicians involved in the child&#8217;s care would be subjected to abusive behaviour in the event that they were to be identified. The evidence relied on at that stage of the proceedings in order to establish the existence of such a risk is likely to be generic, as we have explained. </p>

We would expect &#8211; although, as the matter has not been argued, we do not express any concluded view &#8211; that the clinicians&#8217; participation in the proceedings could properly be funded by the trust, on the basis that the risk which they face has only arisen in consequence of the proceedings for a declaration brought by the trust, for which they are working. </p>

In English law, that interest is protected primarily by the law of defamation. Individuals who wish to prevent the publication of defamatory statements about themselves can apply for an injunction on the basis of their cause of action in defamation. They cannot properly ignore the domestic law of defamation and bring proceedings based solely on section 37(1) of the Senior Courts Act taken together with section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act. That is because our law of defamation is not constituted by article 8 of the Convention, although that provision is relevant to its application. A fortiori, if a third party, such as the individuals&#8217; employer, were to apply for an injunction in order to protect them from defamation, relying on the width of the court&#8217;s powers under section 37(1) of the Senior Courts Act and on section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act, the court would not be acting unlawfully if it refused to grant a remedy in those proceedings. The court does not act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right by insisting that individuals avail themselves of the domestic cause of action which is available to protect that right, and that the action is brought by the individual whose Convention right is in issue. </p>

Our domestic law provides them with causes of action against persons who threaten those interests, and they must normally avail themselves of those causes of action if they wish to obtain a remedy from the courts. Third parties do not normally have standing to apply for a remedy to protect those individuals&#8217; interests, and the courts would not normally be acting unlawfully under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act in declining to grant a remedy on a third party&#8217;s application. In other words, in this context, in so far as the state is under a positive obligation arising from article 8 to intervene in relations between private persons in order to protect such interests, the obligation is usually satisfied by providing the person affected with the means of seeking legal redress.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Although articles 8 and 10 of the Convention are of unquestionable importance, their function is different, as we have explained. Inevitably, since the European court decides specific complaints that domestic authorities have exceeded what is permissible under the Convention, rather than determining the content of domestic law within those limits, its judgments have not established a body of rules or principles which is as rich or detailed as that existing or emerging in our domestic law. Rather, the judgments in cases where articles 8 and 10 are involved are based on an assessment of the facts of individual cases, drawn from a wide variety of legal contexts across the jurisdictions of the Council of Europe, and considered after the domestic proceedings have been completed. The focus of the judgments, in cases concerned with articles 8 and 10, is usually on whether the national margin of appreciation has been exceeded. It can be difficult to derive from them rules more specific than the broad statements of principle which have been repeated over decades. Accordingly, as Lord Mance said in <span style="font-style:italic">Kennedy v Information Comr</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>para 46, &#8220;the natural starting point in any dispute is to start with domestic law, and it is certainly not to focus exclusively on the Convention rights, without surveying the wider common law scene&#8221;. That point (and others we have made about the relationship between the common law and Convention rights) is illustrated by the reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor (Nos 1 and 2) </span>[2017] UKSC 51; [2020] AC 869, para 64 and <span style="font-style:italic">Fearn v Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery </span>[2023] UKSC 4; [2024] AC 1, paras 113 and 206;<span style="font-style:italic"> </span> see also <span style="font-style:italic">QX v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2024] UKSC 26; [2024] 3 WLR 547, para 53. </p>

As we have explained, it enables a hospital authority to apply for an injunction in order to protect the anonymity of clinicians or other staff who are employed by it or are otherwise providing it with their services, where their identification could have consequences which interfered with the authority&#8217;s performance of its statutory duties.</p>

The first of those causes of action is directly focused on the clinicians&#8217; right to privacy. It can provide a practical and effective remedy, even in the circumstances in which proceedings of the present kind are commenced, if the clinicians&#8217; claim for an injunction is joined to that of the trust, and the trust undertakes the necessary preparations. The parens patriae cause of action can also provide the clinicians with effective protection against interferences with their privacy, although it does so as a means of protecting the interests of the child rather than as an end in itself. As we have explained at para 66 above, the duration of the injunction can also be extended to cover a cooling-off period. The <span style="font-style:italic">Broadmoor </span>cause of action can also provide the clinicians with effective protection as a means of ensuring that the trust is able to fulfil its responsibilities towards its patients. Again, the injunction can extend into a cooling-off period.</p>

Counsel for the Trusts argued that section 6(1) obliged the court to grant injunctions to protect the article 8 rights of clinicians, in proceedings at the instance of the Trusts. As we have explained, the equitable jurisdiction is in principle unlimited, subject to any statutory restrictions. Notwithstanding the general rule that parties should protect their Convention rights by availing themselves of the appropriate cause of action under our domestic law, we do not rule out the possibility that there may be circumstances in which it will be proper for the court to exercise its broader equitable jurisdiction so as to ensure that the protection afforded to Convention rights is practical and effective rather than theoretical and illusory. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">However, in the circumstances of proceedings of the present kind, notwithstanding the undoubted pressures upon clinicians, they can normally be provided with practical and effective protection against behaviour which would infringe their article 8 rights by means of one (or a combination of more than one) of the domestic causes of action which we have discussed. Although some of those causes of action treat the protection of clinicians against the risks attendant upon publicity as the means of achieving another objective rather than as an ultimate objective in itself, they are all nevertheless concerned to ensure that clinicians are afforded effective protection against those risks. Whatever the cause of action relied on, an appropriate balancing of interests will be necessary where defendants rely on their own rights under article 10 of the Convention; but that can be done under article 10(2) on the basis that the injunction is sought in the interests of one or more of &#8220;public safety&#8221;, &#8220;the prevention of disorder or crime&#8221;, &#8220;the protection of health&#8221;, &#8220;the protection of the reputation or rights of others&#8221;, or &#8220;preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence&#8221;. Since the precise assessment involved may be affected by the rights relied on, it is preferable in principle that clinicians should assert their own cause of action in order for their interests to be fully taken into account. But in practice, the outcome of the balancing exercise at the outset of proceedings, when (to judge from the present cases) the evidence in support of an injunction is likely to be generic, can be expected in most cases to be the same whether the protection of the clinicians was sought as an end in itself or as the essential means of protecting the interests of the child or of the hospital. Where practical and effective protection can be provided by a domestic cause of action, there is no justification for reliance simply on section 37(1) of the Senior Courts Act, read together with section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act. </p>

Such injunctions can also be supported on the <span style="font-style:italic">Broadmoor </span>basis, in so far as they are necessary in order to prevent interferences with the trusts&#8217; performance of their statutory functions. Such orders can also be granted on the application of the clinicians themselves (or a representative clinician), on the basis of their rights, notably under the tort of invasion of privacy. There is no objection in principle to the issuing of injunctions contra mundum to protect the interests of the child, or to protect the integrity of the court&#8217;s process, or to prevent interferences with the trusts&#8217; performance of their statutory functions.

Alternatively, the proceedings may end with a decision to grant the declaration sought, in which event the death of the child is likely to follow within a short time. A third possibility is that the proceedings may end with a decision to refuse the declaration sought, in which event the child will continue to receive life-sustaining treatment. A fourth possibility, albeit remote, is that the child may continue to live even if the declaration is granted and life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn. Accordingly, there are in broad terms two situations in which the question of jurisdiction may arise after the proceedings have ended: first, where the child has died, and secondly, where the child continues to live. We will consider each of those situations in turn, but devote more attention to the former situation, both because it is likely to be more common, and because it was the situation which arose in the cases before us. </p>

We are unable to accept that contention. The effect of section 6(1) is that the court cannot lawfully discharge the injunctions if to do so would be incompatible with Convention rights. No such incompatibility can arise where the clinicians have a cause of action readily available to them at that stage, enabling them to seek the continuation of the injunctions (or the grant of fresh injunctions) in order to protect their Convention rights, but have failed to make use of it. Section 6(1) does not require the court to protect the Convention rights of individuals who are not parties to the proceedings before the court but could be parties if they chose.</p>

Without a pleaded cause of action, supported by a body of evidence, the court may &#8211; as in the present proceedings &#8211; know little if anything about the circumstances of the individual clinicians, the nature of any apprehensions they may hold and the reasons for their being apprehensive, if indeed that is the case. Furthermore, as we will explain, it may not be possible, either under domestic law or consistently with the Convention, to treat them simply as an undifferentiated group. The court may not even know whether they wish to assert their rights, whether under the Convention or under domestic law. These issues may not loom large when an injunction is sought in circumstances of urgency at the outset of proceedings &#8211; at that stage, as we have explained, it is understandable that reliance should be placed on generic evidence &#8211; but they are of greater significance if the continuation of the injunction is in question after the declaration proceedings have ended.</p>

That might be regarded as a broad interpretation of section 7(1).  Nevertheless, in <span style="font-style:italic">In re S </span>and related cases, such as <span style="font-style:italic">In re Guardian News and Media Ltd</span>, the House of Lords remained faithful to Parliament&#8217;s intention that claims based on section 6(1) should be brought by individuals who were (or would be) victims of the unlawful act; and it also remained faithful to the broader intention that the Human Rights Act should enable individuals to obtain relief in domestic courts where there was or might be a breach of their rights under the Convention, rather than having to make an application to the European court. In the present proceedings, on the other hand, public authorities &#8211; which have no standing as victims in relation to the potential violation of the Convention rights relied upon &#8211; seek to use the Human Rights Act to obtain relief against private individuals, on the basis that the court&#8217;s failure to grant that relief would violate the Convention rights of third parties who are strangers to the proceedings.

In short, where the continuation of an order against private individuals and organisations is sought for the purpose of preventing an invasion of clinicians&#8217; right to privacy, or other wrongful conduct directed against them, then that should normally be based on the clinicians&#8217; assertion of their own cause of action against those individuals and organisations.</p>

It also follows that where an injunction granted on the application of a trust has the practical effect of protecting the rights of clinicians, notice of the injunction, and of any application for its variation or discharge, should be given to the clinicians affected.

The trust also has standing to apply for an order under the <span style="font-style:italic">Broadmoor </span>jurisdiction in order to prevent interferences with its own performance of its statutory functions.

If, however, the basis on which the continuation of the injunction is sought is in order to protect the rights of the clinicians, as in the present proceedings, then the parties with standing to seek the protection of their rights are the clinicians themselves. Where appropriate, one clinician can be party to the proceedings as the representative of others, in accordance with CPR r 19.8. However, the roles of clinicians, and their vulnerability to abuse, may differ even within a clinical team, especially where the publicity sought to be restrained is directed at particular individuals.

Those rules were in force at all times material to these proceedings. Accordingly, the judge could have excluded the media representatives from the hearing under rule 27.11(3), in the unlikely event that they were unwilling to respect the anonymity of the witnesses (unlikely, because the media had not opposed the grant of the injunction or sought its variation or discharge in order to enable their reports of the proceedings to include the witnesses&#8217; identities). He could have done so either on his own initiative or pursuant to representations by King&#8217;s or Isaiah&#8217;s CAFCASS guardian: representations which would have been highly likely, in order to protect the clinicians and Isaiah, if there had been any question of the witnesses&#8217; identities being published.</p>

As Munby J said in <span style="font-style:italic">Kelly v British Broadcasting Corpn </span>[2001] Fam 59, 72, summarising a number of earlier authorities, &#8220;in essence, what section 12 protects is the privacy and confidentiality: (i) of the documents on the court file and (ii) of what has gone on in front of the judge in his courtroom&#8221;. Accordingly, it covers the names of the witnesses who gave evidence or provided statements, the identities of the experts who provided reports, and the contents of their evidence, statements and reports. It follows that, by virtue of section 12, the publication of the witnesses&#8217; and experts&#8217; names, either by the media or by the parents, would have rendered them liable to proceedings for contempt of court. That reflects the common law: <span style="font-style:italic">In re Martindale </span>[1894] 3 Ch 193; <span style="font-style:italic">In re De Beaujeu&#8217;s Application for Writ of Attachment against Cudlipp </span>[1949] Ch 230.

If oral evidence had been given, or statements or reports adduced, by the clinicians whose anonymity was protected by the injunction, it would have been open to the judge to exclude the public or to take the less drastic step of permitting their names to be withheld (see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney General v Leveller Magazine Ltd </span>[1979] AC 440). If the public were excluded, the position would be the same as in the Haastrup proceedings. If the names were withheld, the court could exercise its power under section 11 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 to give directions prohibiting their publication. In those circumstances, the injunction would not prevent the publication of anything which could otherwise have been published. </p>

It is also protected by statute: notably by section 12(3) and (4) of the Human Rights Act.

As we have explained, the principles established in the case law under the Convention are often expressed at a higher level of generality than those of our domestic law, and their application to particular facts generally calls for a broader exercise of judgement by the court. However, it is important to bear in mind that the starting point is our domestic law. The case law interpreting the Convention is important as setting limits to what is permissible under the Human Rights Act, but it is not an exhaustive guide to how our law should protect either privacy or freedom of expression, or should strike a balance between them. </p>

In assessing whether there has been a breach of article 10 (or, mutatis mutandis, a breach of article 8), the court begins by asking whether there was an interference prescribed by the law. The next question is whether it pursued a legitimate aim, ie an aim which can be justified with reference to one or more of the matters mentioned in article 10(2) (or article 8(2), as the case may be). The remaining question is whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society. It is at that stage that the court may be required to strike a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the Convention which may come into conflict with each other: <span style="font-style:italic">Axel Springer AG v Germany </span>(2012) 55 EHRR 6<span style="font-style:italic">, </span>para 84.</p>

They are: (1) the time of the institution of the proceedings; (2) the time between then and the end of the proceedings, generally when the court decides whether to grant the declaration sought (or, if earlier, when the child dies); (3) a specified cooling-off period immediately after the end of the proceedings; and (4) the potentially limitless period thereafter.</p>

The risk may not however be completely impossible to gauge, because the trust is likely to know by then whether, for example, there is developing an acute difference of view between parents and clinicians as to the child&#8217;s best interests, and whether the case has attracted public attention. By comparison with a professional difference or uncertainty about the treatment which will be in the best interests of the child, the parents versus clinicians type of dispute is far more likely to lead to the abusive results of publicity.</p>

Such focus as is given to the obtaining of an injunction is likely to be directed at the second stage, ie the period during which the proceedings are live, while the child continues to live in a state of grave illness and possibly pain and distress. For that period the protection of an injunction is likely to be in the best interests of the child, both to protect the child&#8217;s right to confidentiality and privacy, and to limit as far as possible the risk of collateral damage to the continued care being provided by the hospital to the child.

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">At that second stage the question whether to grant an injunction requires the court to consider whether to do so (or to fail to do so) would be incompatible with the Convention rights which have been properly raised before it. Those are likely to include the article 8 rights of the child (and of the clinicians, if they have been joined to the proceedings) and the article 10 rights of the parents, the media and the general public. Both article 8 and article 10 guarantee qualified rights with built-in derogations, enabling the proportionality analysis required under the Convention to be carried out. The legal framework establishing the court&#8217;s jurisdiction and the relevant causes of action, as described above, means that any proportionate restrictions upon those article 10 rights which are embedded in the order will be prescribed by law, within the meaning of article 10 (and the same applies, mutatis mutandis, in relation to article 8).</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The primary focus of both the trust as applicant and of the court itself, in fashioning an appropriate order at the outset of the proceedings, will be upon its likely effect in managing the risks which might result from publicity during the second stage, ie while the proceedings remain live.  As we have explained, during that stage the proportionality balance is likely (at least where the proceedings are brought to resolve a clinicians versus parents dispute) to come down in favour of the grant of some kind of injunction, but only for that stage. Thus an order is likely to need to be time-limited, either so as to expire automatically at the end of the proceedings or, as we suggested at para 66 above, so as to expire at the end of a chosen cooling-off period thereafter; subject, in either case, to further application. Thus, in <span style="font-style:italic">In re M (Declaration of Death of Child)</span> [2020] EWCA Civ 164; [2020] 4 WLR 52 the injunction was limited by consent to a period of 28 days after the removal of ventilatory support, subject to further application. This cooling-off period is the third of the stages listed above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the end of the proceedings may often be more or less contemporaneous with the child&#8217;s death, which brings the parens patriae jurisdiction to an end, the injunction need not necessarily come to an immediate end at that point; and there are practical reasons why it may often be desirable that it should not. It would be unfortunate, to say the least, in cases where the parents and the trust are in disagreement, if the law required their lawyers to be on standby during the child&#8217;s final hours, ready to file applications as soon as death occurred. Nor should the clinicians be distracted from their responsibilities at that time by the need to initiate legal proceedings for their own protection (if they are not already party to the proceedings). The availability of grounds for maintaining the injunction in place for a time (including the <span style="font-style:italic">Broadmoor </span>jurisdiction), and the breadth of the court&#8217;s equitable discretion in framing injunctions, allow it to avoid that problem. The extension of an injunction granted at the outset of proceedings into a cooling-off period will allow time for the trust to assess whether a longer continuation of the injunction is necessary. It will also allow time for clinicians (and perhaps others within the trust&#8217;s staff) to prepare for obtaining longer-term anonymity, in the specific protection of their own rights to privacy, in cases where they perceive it to be necessary. They should have a reasonable time to consider their own legal position once the pressure of dealing with the clinical needs of the child has passed. </p>

The interest of the media and the public in a case where a decision about a child&#8217;s life or death remains to be taken, and where there is still some chance of preserving the child&#8217;s life, is almost bound to be greater than in an essentially historical case about a child who has died (or in a case where the proceedings have ended in a decision that the child should continue to receive life-sustaining treatment). By contrast the importance of the rights of the parents to freedom of expression is unlikely to suffer a comparable decline.  They are likely to want to speak out about their side of an argument about the treatment of their child for the rest of their lives.</p>

For that purpose the court may at the outset have some information relevant to the risks of harm from publicity during the cooling-off period, for example from evidence as to the nature of the dispute (if any) which the court is being asked to resolve by the bringing of the proceedings.  </p>

The trust will no longer be an appropriate applicant, unless there remains a real risk of interference with its performance of its statutory functions. The clinicians themselves should receive notice of any application for the discharge of the injunction so as to enable them (or, where appropriate, a representative on their behalf) to make their own application for a fresh injunction, either in the existing proceedings or in new proceedings, if they consider that to be necessary.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">At this fourth stage, a number of factors need to be borne in mind. The first is that the original scenario, in which the protection of the clinical team&#8217;s rights to privacy could be achieved as an ancillary consequence of an injunction whose purpose was to protect the child and the caring work of the hospital, is likely to have passed. Instead, the continuation of anonymity after the end of the cooling-off period in order to protect the privacy of clinicians requires, under the Convention, a balancing exercise between the article 8 rights of a specific group of clinicians and the article 10 rights of those whom the injunction would restrain.</p>

There is no similar reason why the clinicians who seek protection should not take time to set out the evidence specific to them which establishes why a relaxation of their anonymity should cause a disproportionate invasion of their rights to privacy, nor why those who wish to speak out and name names<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>should not also be able to condescend to the detail necessary to enable the court to carry out its task reliably.</p>

At that stage, the conclusion of the proceedings is likely to have reduced the weight of the case for anonymity to one which is much more likely to be matched or outweighed by the rights to freedom of expression of those wishing to speak out.  </p>

It is wrong that at that stage the parents should have to take all the burden and risk of defending their article 10 rights against the opposition of a state-funded health service, where that opposition is being deployed to protect the equally private rights of the clinicians.</p>

The court retains its broad equitable jurisdiction to grant an injunction aimed at minimising the risk of unlawful harassment or invasions of privacy (or the commission of other wrongful behaviour), and may in principle do so by restraining innocent persons, such as the parents or the media, if that is the only way of ensuring that unidentified members of the public do not use publicity as the basis for harassment thereafter. And its status as a public authority for the purposes of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act will be sufficient for it to conduct a balancing exercise between competing article 8 and article 10 rights, applying the criteria identified in the case law of the European court, for the purpose of ensuring that its decision either to discharge or to continue the injunction is compatible with those rights. </p>

No clinicians or other hospital staff took part. There is no indication that they had received notice of the applications. The President recorded that the Trusts did not rely on the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction with respect to the welfare of the children (who had, of course, died), nor on any other aspect of the inherent jurisdiction, nor on the tort of misuse of private information. Nor was any reliance placed on the <span style="font-style:italic">Broadmoor </span>principle. The court&#8217;s jurisdiction to continue the injunctions or to grant fresh injunctions was said to derive from the existence of the applications. Given their existence, the court was (it was argued) under a duty to deal with them in accordance with section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act by carrying out a balancing exercise between the rights of the clinicians under article 8 and those of the parents and others under article 10. The President accepted that submission and proceeded on that basis.</p>

Section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act did not in itself provide such a basis, for the reasons explained earlier. Nor did the Trusts have standing to assert the clinicians&#8217; rights either under the common law or under the Convention, as explained above. If the court was to be asked to continue or grant injunctions in order to protect the clinicians&#8217; rights, at a stage when the parens patriae jurisdiction was no longer available and no reliance was placed on the <span style="font-style:italic">Broadmoor </span>jurisdiction, there should have been an application by the clinicians themselves, who should have received notice of the Trusts&#8217; and the parents&#8217; applications. </p>

Instead, the evidence was concerned with the harassment of hospital staff in other cases &#8211; particularly those of Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans. It was understandable that reliance should have been placed on generic evidence at the outset of the proceedings, but much less so after a number of years had passed and there was experience of the results of publicity in the particular cases before the court (see paras 12, 15, 18 and 33-34 above). Furthermore, the evidence relating to the Gard and Evans cases concerned events which had occurred at a time when the proceedings remained active. That evidence was of limited assistance in assessing the risks involved in the Abbasi and Haastrup proceedings long after the children had died. However, neither the submissions nor the President&#8217;s reasoning appear to have grasped the importance of the lapse of time that had occurred in the present cases. </p>

First, the President accepted a submission that the requirements set out in article 10(2) of the Convention &#8220;do not apply to a horizontal dispute between individuals, or groups of individuals, such as the present&#8221; (para 85). Accordingly, &#8220;reference to the matters set out in article 10(2) are (sic) not required in a horizontal dispute such as the present&#8221; (para 113). With respect, that is not correct. Where it is sought to impose a restriction on freedom of expression, the restriction must be justifiable under article 10(2). It must be prescribed by law, it must pursue a legitimate aim, referable to one or more of the matters set out in article 10(2) (i.e. &#8220;in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary&#8221;), and it must be necessary in a democratic society. A restriction which was not justifiable under article 10(2) would be incompatible with the Convention rights of the person restrained. That would be so whether the restriction was imposed in proceedings brought by a public authority (as, in fact, the proceedings before the President were), or in proceedings brought by a private individual.   </p>

The President said that he would dissociate himself from that passage, and asked rhetorically why the law should support a situation in which conscientious and caring professionals are at risk of harassment and vilification simply for doing their job (para 96). We agree. The fact that the internet is awash with harassment and vilification is no reason why anyone should be expected to put up with it, if it reaches a level which constitutes an interference with their legal rights. </p>

The President considered that Munby LJ&#8217;s conclusion (as he interpreted it) that &#8220;compelling&#8221; reasons were required was at odds with Lord Steyn&#8217;s statement in <span style="font-style:italic">In re S, </span>para 17, in relation to articles 8 and 10 of the Convention, that &#8220;neither article has <span style="font-style:italic">as such </span>precedence over the other&#8221; (emphasis in the original).

The Grand Chamber has also said that &#8220;a journalist cannot in principle be required to defer publishing information on a subject of general interest without compelling reasons relating to the public interest or protection of the rights of others&#8221;: <span style="font-style:italic">Stoll v Switzerland </span>(2008) 47 EHRR 59, para 131.

Indeed, this court has also referred to the need for &#8220;compelling&#8221; submissions or &#8220;compelling&#8221; evidence to justify restrictions of freedom of expression: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">In re Guardian News and Media Ltd, </span>paras 17 and 74, in relation to anonymity orders designed to protect article 8 rights, and <span style="font-style:italic">In re Abortion Services (Safe Access Zones) (Northern Ireland) Bill </span>[2022] UKSC 32; [2023] AC 505, paras 117 and 137, in relation to restrictions on rights of protest intended to protect article 8 rights. </p>

That does not in any way imply that the interests protected by article 10 have, as such, precedence over the interests protected by article 8. Clearly, there are many situations in which restrictions on freedom of expression are justified in order to protect the rights of others (including rights protected by article 8), as article 10(2) itself recognises.

The President was in a position to consider whether the parents&#8217; complaints in relation to those matters could be rejected as totally without substance or merit, and therefore of no weight in the article 10 assessment. Dr Abbasi&#8217;s criticisms of Zainab&#8217;s treatment were based on his and his wife&#8217;s medical expertise and experience, including his expertise and experience as a consultant respiratory physician. As regards the Haastrup case, the negligence of King&#8217;s staff during Isaiah&#8217;s birth was admitted.

We accept that the court&#8217;s powers are wide enough in principle to enable it to grant and continue injunctions in order to protect Convention rights even in the absence of any claim by the persons whose rights are in question. As we have explained, however, such a step would only be justified in unusual circumstances. Where the persons whose rights are sought to be protected could readily bring a claim themselves, there is no obligation on the court under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act to issue or continue an injunction on the application of a third party. </p>

We do not see any relevant similarity between the two situations.</p>

At the same time, as the Court of Appeal correctly noted, there is no hierarchical primacy as between article 8 and article 10. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to the merits of the applications, the Court of Appeal began by considering the article 8 rights of the clinicians. As they noted, the continuation of the injunctions was sought because of a risk that the exercise of free speech by the parents or the press might result in a social media reaction by third parties. The concern was not about what the parents might say, or about reporting in the mainstream media: the concern was about the possibility that a furore might develop on social media, with consequences for the clinicians&#8217; safety and wellbeing.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In assessing that possibility, the first point to note, in relation to the Abbasi proceedings, is that the identity of the Newcastle Trust had ceased to be protected by the injunction on Zainab&#8217;s death, in September 2019; and the identity of the hospital where Zainab was treated had ceased to be protected in July 2020 (see paras 12, 24 and 25 above). That variation of the injunction was followed by widespread media coverage of the case (paras 12 and 33 above). As we have explained, once the hospital was known, the senior paediatric clinicians who worked there could be identified from the Trust&#8217;s website; and anyone versed in searching the internet might be able to discover further personal details, such as addresses and telephone numbers. Yet there was no evidence that the disclosure of the identity of the Trust or of the hospital resulted in any adverse consequences for any clinicians or for the hospital itself by the time of the hearing before the Court of Appeal in mid-November 2022.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In those circumstances, the Court of Appeal concluded that, whatever the position might have been at the time when the injunctions were originally granted, the current risk to the article 8 rights of the four clinicians in the Abbasi case, and of the NHS staff generally in the Haastrup case, by reason of their being identified by the parents and then by the press, was low. By contrast, the impact of the continuation of the injunctions on the article 10 rights of the parents was unquestionable and serious. In both cases, the parents wished to publish details of their experiences and concerns in an area of public controversy. The moral and ethical questions surrounding the treatment of children and adults in positions analogous to Zainab and Isaiah generate intense public debate. Naming the clinicians involved is relevant to that debate. The Court of Appeal referred to the well-known passage in the judgment of Lord Rodger in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Guardian News and Media Ltd</span>, para 63, explaining why in media reporting on a matter of public interest it may be editorially important to name individuals:</p>

Those involved in clinical negligence resulting in death would need a factually quite exceptional case to secure anonymity. Accordingly, taking account only of the Convention rights of the clinicians, and balancing them against the parents&#8217; rights to freedom of expression, the parents&#8217; rights decisively prevailed. </p>

As the Court of Appeal noted, these concerns do not relate to the particular facts of these cases or to the circumstances of any individual. The argument, if accepted in the form in which it is put, would support permanent injunctions to protect medical and nursing staff as a class in every such case, creating a general category of restrictions on freedom of speech. </p>

The Grand Chamber has accepted that the judiciary must enjoy public confidence if it is to perform its role in a democratic society. Nevertheless, it has held that, &#8220;save in the case of gravely damaging attacks that are essentially unfounded&#8221;, judges &#8220;may &#8230; be subject to personal criticism within the permissible limits, and not only in a theoretical and general manner&#8221;. Indeed, since they form part of a fundamental institution of the state, they &#8220;may be subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than ordinary citizens&#8221;: <span style="font-style:italic">Morice v France, </span>para 131.

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">More recently, in <span style="font-style:italic">Frisk and Jensen v Denmark </span>the court considered a complaint that article 10 had been violated by the conviction and fining of journalists under the Danish penal code for defaming a public hospital and one of its consultants. The journalists were responsible for a television programme which had accused the hospital and the consultant in question of malpractice in the treatment of patients. The European court treated the attack on the hospital as an attack on the reputation of its management and staff, and accepted that the applicants&#8217; conviction and punishment were aimed at protecting the &#8220;reputation of others&#8221; and had a legitimate aim under article 10(2). However, the court also accepted that the programme in question dealt with issues of legitimate public interest. The criticism was directed at a public hospital, including its management and staff. They were public figures, vested with official functions, and the limits of acceptable criticism were wider than in the case of private individuals. As the court noted (para 60), it was accepted that there was a need for wider limits for public scrutiny because the activities of the hospital and its conditions had an impact on the life and health of individuals. The court also cited with apparent approval the Danish court&#8217;s statement that &#8220;in respect of public hospital treatment, when balancing considerations of freedom of expression with considerations of the protection of the name and reputation of persons and companies, the former is accorded tremendous weight on the scale&#8221; (ibid). The court proceeded to apply its usual criteria when balancing the right to freedom of expression against the right to respect for private life, and concluded that there had been no violation of article 10, primarily because the accusations made in the programme were unfounded in fact. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In the light of this body of case law, we conclude that the protection of clinicians and other staff working in public hospitals from unfounded accusations is a legitimate aim. It is reasonable to infer that analogous reasoning could also apply to the protection of such persons from other forms of intrusion upon their article 8 rights. The importance of that legitimate aim could be relevant to the justification of a restriction on freedom of expression, whether considered under article 8 (in determining the weight under article 8(2) of &#8220;the rights and freedoms of others&#8221;) or under article 10 (in determining the weight under article 10(2) of &#8220;the reputation or rights of others&#8221;). We do not, therefore, agree with the Court of Appeal that considerations of that kind cannot by their nature be relevant to the article 8 rights of hospital staff. However, it is also clear from the case law that, although the protection of clinicians and other staff working in public hospitals can be a legitimate aim of a restriction on freedom of expression, such a restriction will only be compatible with article 10 if it meets some important requirements, including that it does not impose a disproportionate restriction on debate on matters of general public interest, and that it does not prevent responsible criticism, including personal criticism, in cases of legitimate concern.</p>

That does not, however, imply that the concerns expressed about the potential impact of attacks on clinicians and other hospital staff on morale and recruitment are irrelevant. Account can be taken of the importance of protecting the medical and other staff of public hospitals against unfounded accusations and consequent abuse. However, the court should also bear in mind that the treatment of patients in public hospitals is a matter of legitimate public interest, and that the medical and other staff of public hospitals are public figures for the purposes of the Convention, with the consequence that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider than in the case of private individuals.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">As we have explained, the only basis on which the continuation of the injunctions was sought was to protect the rights of clinicians; but those rights were not being asserted by the clinicians themselves. If, on the other hand, there had been an application by the clinicians for the continuation of the injunctions in order to protect them from an invasion of privacy (or some other form of wrongful conduct), then the court would have had to consider whether the evidence demonstrated a real risk of such wrongful conduct. The evidence before the courts below did not demonstrate such a risk, as we have explained. If, however, the evidence had demonstrated such a risk, then the court would have had to consider whether the interference with the right to freedom of expression resulting from the continuation of the injunction was prescribed by law (clearly, it would have been on the hypothesis we are contemplating, as the clinicians&#8217; application would have been based on the law of tort, or equity, or statute, as the case might be); whether it pursued a legitimate aim (clearly, it would have done, on that hypothesis); and whether it was necessary in a democratic society and struck a fair balance between the competing values, bearing in mind that &#8220;the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly&#8221; (see para 159 above). Given that the parents&#8217; publication of their concerns would contribute to a debate of general interest, and given also that the hospital staff concerned were, for the purposes of article 10, public figures vested with official functions, and that the limits of acceptable criticism were accordingly wider than in the case of private individuals, it appears to us that it would be difficult to justify the continuation of the injunctions in the absence of evidence demonstrating a real and continuing threat of a serious nature.  </p>

This consideration applies with particular force to preventive restraints on publication, and is reflected in section 12(3) and (4) of the Human Rights Act.</p>

However, the court should also bear in mind that the treatment of patients in public hospitals is a matter of legitimate public interest, and that the medical and other staff of public hospitals are public figures for the purposes of the Convention, with the consequence that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider than in the case of private individuals.</p>

I write a short judgment of my own to emphasise that it is important to remember that in cases of this sort the clinicians have rights as well, which also require respect and protection. By clinicians I mean the doctors, nurses and medical staff involved in treating a very ill or dying child. The harassment of clinicians which can sometimes occur in these situations was a strong feature of the Charlie Gard case. As Lord Reed and Lord Briggs observe, this appears to be a problem mainly associated with the initial phase of events, when the child is being treated. My comments below are concerned with that phase.</p>

The applications made by the hospital trusts for injunctive relief were supported by evidence which made it clear that the trusts were principally concerned with the impact on the clinicians from harassment to which they might be exposed and the trusts maintained that the clinicians&#8217; rights, particularly under article 8 of the European Convention, should be protected. In the appeal before us this was all treated as water under the bridge, because the issue we have to resolve concerns the current position in respect of injunctions granted at that earlier stage. Circumstances have changed.</p>

I think they proceeded in a laudable and appropriate manner.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">As Lord Reed and Lord Briggs point out, there are three sets of interests by reference to which the grant of injunctive relief to protect clinicians might be justified: those of the child (under the court&#8217;s parens patriae jurisdiction), those of the hospital trust as a body providing a service to the public (<span style="font-style:italic">Broadmoor Special Hospital Authority v Robinson</span> [2000] QB 775) and the personal rights of the clinicians themselves. There may often be an overlap between these interests. But there may not be. For example, in certain circumstances it may be in the best interests of the child to give publicity to their case (say, if it is in their interests to try to raise money via crowdfunding to pay for a very expensive treatment not available on the NHS). In certain circumstances the public service interest of the hospital trust may not cover the rights of an individual clinician (eg if a clinician leaves the employment of the trust part way through the treatment being provided to the child, but remains subject to harassment). So one cannot be sure that the interests of the child and the interests of the trust will serve as an adequate proxy for the interests of clinicians, meaning that the court does not need to consider their rights. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover, there is no requirement to go to court in a case involving proposed withdrawal of treatment if there is no dispute about the best interests of the child: see <span style="font-style:italic">An NHS Trust v Y </span>[2018] UKSC 46; [2019] AC 978 a case involving withdrawal of treatment from an adult without capacity where general guidance was given which has been treated as relevant to children in <span style="font-style:italic">An NHS Trust v DV (A Child) </span>[2021] EWHC 1037 (Fam); 180 BMLR 169, para 33, and <span style="font-style:italic">R (Bell) v Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust</span> [2021] EWCA Civ 1363; [2022] PTSR 544, paras 85-86. Yet the risk of harassment of clinicians may exist in circumstances where there is no such dispute. Quite apart from the views the child&#8217;s family might have, it has been a feature of some of the cases involving withdrawal of treatment from a very ill or dying child (and as has been seen in other cases involving clinicians, such as in relation to provision of abortion services) that third parties may strongly disapprove of the proposed treatment or withdrawal of treatment and may seek to harass clinicians involved in the individual case or in that and other similar cases. So there may not be occasion to invoke the parens patriae jurisdiction of the court to determine the best interests of the child, and the impact on the child of actions against the clinicians might be negligible, yet the clinicians might be at risk of being subjected to harassment in breach of their rights. </p>

In my view, it would be appropriate for the court to respond directly to the claim actually brought in such cases, as they did in the Abbasi and the Haastrup cases, namely by identifying the rights of the clinicians themselves and granting relief to protect those rights. In all these cases, the rights of the clinicians have legal significance in the same way as do the rights of the children. A court should not disregard legal rights, wherever they exist and are properly invoked. Also, analytically, since in such cases the impact on the best interests of the child is an indirect consequence of the impact of the harassment on the clinicians, the rights of the clinicians are implicated more directly and are, so to speak, in the front line of the rights requiring protection from the courts rather than in some way a subsidiary matter of concern or irrelevant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The concrete implementation of those rights will be mediated primarily through existing legal rights in domestic law, taking account of the state&#8217;s margin of appreciation. So, for example, where the common law can already be seen to have struck an appropriate balance between the competing rights and interests at stake, within the state&#8217;s margin of appreciation, there is no need to look back beyond that to the underlying Convention rights, nor is there any justification to disturb that balance by reference to those rights (see P Sales, &#8220;Constitutional Values in the Common Law of Obligations&#8221; [2024] CLJ 132, 154). Where individual rights are being balanced, the margin of appreciation is usually wide (see <span style="font-style:italic">In re JR123 </span>[2025] UKSC 8; [2025] 2 WLR 435, para 54), and this tends to reduce the need or justification for direct reference back to the Convention rights. But the possibility that the common law or statute does not strike an acceptable balance in particular cases cannot be completely discounted, in which case a court as a public authority for the purposes of the Human Rights Act 1998 (&#8220;the HRA&#8221;) (see section 6(3)), subject to a duty to act compatibly with Convention rights (section 6(1)), may be obliged to conduct its own balancing exercise by reference to the Convention rights. In order for a court which has to decide whether to grant an injunction to engage in an assessment in relation to any of these forms of balancing of the competing rights of the parents and the clinicians, it is first necessary that the clinicians&#8217; rights have been validly asserted or placed before the court. Otherwise, there is nothing in the scales to be weighed against the rights of the parents and the metaphor of balancing makes no sense.</p>

The child has different Convention and domestic law rights of their own, which may sometimes be in conflict with the rights of the clinicians. The hospital trust, as a public authority, unlike the clinicians, does not have relevant Convention rights of its own to be balanced against the Convention rights of the parents. Also, the trust&#8217;s interests and its domestic law rights are different in character and content from those of the clinicians. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Two points are relevant here. First, in the pressurised circumstances of the initial phase, the clinicians do not have a fair opportunity to consider, seek legal advice about and take legal proceedings to protect their rights. Their attention is understandably elsewhere, directed to providing care for the child. They should not be distracted from that. It would be completely unreasonable to expect them to have to worry about their own legal position and about taking legal steps to protect themselves and (as may be the case) their families from harassment, assault and so on. If in this phase their Convention rights are to be practical and effective rather than theoretical and illusory, as is required by the Convention (see <span style="font-style:italic">Airey v Ireland</span> (1979-1980) 2 EHRR 305, para 24, and &#8220;[t]his is particularly so of the right of access to the courts in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial&#8221;), someone has to step in to assert those rights on their behalf in legal proceedings. The law has to be pragmatic about this. A limited departure from the usual position set out at para 193 above is required.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, if the court is to receive claims and submissions made on behalf of the clinicians, but not by the clinicians themselves, in the initial phase, it needs to be satisfied that the person doing that is someone who can be taken to be in a good position to assume that role. The hospital trust is the obvious person. It is the body which is responsible for the care being provided to the child and for managing the situation in relation to that. It is in a good position to raise with the court all matters bearing on the fair and appropriate management of the situation in relation to which the court might need to take action and grant relief. Moreover, the trust is usually the employer of the clinicians involved, and so in general terms has responsibility for their welfare in relation to their employment and more specifically owes them a duty of care to provide them with a safe working environment. Where the protection required by the European Convention for an individual&#8217;s Convention rights is mediated through rights existing in domestic law, the courts should likewise recognise that the trust has standing in the initial phase to act on behalf of the clinicians to assert those rights.</p>

However, I do not think it was a fatal flaw in the procedure adopted in the heat of the moment at the outset of the proceedings that this was not done. It was a procedural misstep which could be corrected later on, should any problem arise because of it. </p>

Joinder by itself merely affords the clinicians an opportunity to participate in the proceedings, should they choose to do so, and has the effect that they are bound by any order which is made. But the point made above is that they should not have to worry about being active in asserting their rights in the initial phase. A court will not act to protect the clinicians&#8217; rights unless someone with standing to do so asserts that it should and presents submissions to persuade it to act. In the initial phase, it is the trust who is best placed to do that on behalf of the clinicians while their attention is, for compelling reasons, elsewhere. </p>

In the sort of case we are concerned with, the clinicians do have victim status, so that is not a problem. In the initial phase, the question is whether anyone has standing to act on their behalf to assert their rights as victims. For the reasons given above, in my opinion the courts in the Abbasi and Haastrup cases and in the other cases where the issue of protecting clinicians&#8217; rights has arisen have been right to treat the relevant hospital trust as having such standing in the initial phase.</p>
