My Lord, the applicant is not here. \\n2.\\nLORD JUSTICE LAWS: The case should be called outside. \\n3.\\nTHE USHER: There is no reply. \\n4.\\nLORD JUSTICE LAWS: This an application for permission to appeal against an order of Mr Jack Beatson QC sitting as a Deputy Judge in the Queen's Bench Division made on 26 September 2001 when he struck out the applicant's application for a certificate of inadequacy pursuant to section 14 of the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 in relation to a confiscation order in the sum of £750,000 which had been made against him following his conviction on charges of drug trafficking. I refused permission to appeal on the papers on 26 November 2001. \\n5.\\nThe applicant is not present. He is serving the prison sentence which was passed on him for the drug trafficking offences. It appears that on 2 January 2002 he wrote from prison a letter to the Civil Appeals Office in which he said: \\n“As you are aware, I spoke to you on the phone and I am writing this letter to confirm that I want to renew my appeal hearing myself personally.” \\n6.\\nOn 10 January 2002 the Civil Appeals Office wrote to the applicant at the prison giving notice of today's date. There is no reason whatever to suppose that he did not receive that letter. It was sent to the prison where he is currently serving his sentence. \\n7.\\nSo far as I am aware no application has been made for any special arrangements to be put in place so that he might be brought from the prison to the Royal Courts of Justice in order to prosecute his application. Since for reasons which I shall shortly explain it seems to me that the application is entirely hopeless, I do not propose to set in train any such arrangement of my own motion. \\n8.\\nThe essential facts are these. The applicant was convicted on 28 April 1995 by a jury at the Southwark Crown Court of conspiring to supply large quantities of crack cocaine. His Honour Judge Rivlin QC sentenced him to 20 years' imprisonment. The Crown applied for a confiscation order against the applicant under the drug trafficking legislation. Judge Rivlin assessed the applicant's benefit from his crime at not less than £1.3 million and his realisable assets at £750,000. In consequence he made an order by which the applicant was to pay the lesser of these two sums within twelve months or serve an additional three years' imprisonment in default. \\n9.\\nThe figure for the benefit was based principally upon an estimate of the profits of the whole conspiracy. That was largely founded on a record of cash transfers which had been made by the conspirators through a Thomas Cook bureau de change, and there was also evidence of the applicant's lavish lifestyle. \\n10.\\nAs to the figure for realisable assets, the learned judge entirely discounted the evidence given to him by the applicant on that matter. He arrived at his figure of £750,000 by making what he considered to be the justifiable assumption that a conspirator in such a criminal operation as this would undoubtedly have retained much of the profit gained from the conspiracy. The judge then reduced that figure because it appeared that the majority of the assets were abroad and the applicant might have to rely upon others to produce them. \\n11.\\nThe applicant appealed against his sentence. On 8 March 1996 the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, gave judgment against him. It is to be noticed that the confiscation order was not challenged on the criminal appeal. On 28 July 1997 the High Court appointed a receiver over the defendant's affairs. The receiver recovered, however, no more than £18,900 odd. \\n12.\\nOn 6 September 2001, the applicant's then solicitors filed an application in the Administrative Court for a certificate pursuant to section 14 of the 1986 Act. The certificate would be to the effect that the value of the applicant's realisable property was inadequate for payment of the amount remaining due from him under the terms of the confiscation order. A sworn affidavit was put in by the applicant. At paragraph 9 he said: \\n“There is now fresh evidence as to the amount of realisable assets. On 28 July 1997 a receiver, Nicholas O'Reilly of Rothman Pantall and Co was appointed by the High Court, in respect of the confiscation order. I exhibit a copy of the report produced by the receiver .... The report states that all assets have been realised pursuant to the confiscation order. The assets total £18,920.72. I was willing to assist the receiver and he had extensive powers to investigate and locate all my assets if indeed there were any.” \\n13.\\nAt paragraph 10 he continued: \\n“The position is as follows: \\na.The amount realised by the appointed receiver represents the whole of my realisable property; \\nb.I do not possess the means to pay the amount outstanding under the Confiscation Order; \\nc.I have no other realisable property within, or outside, the jurisdiction; \\nd.I have no bank accounts abroad in my name or in nominee accounts; \\ne.I have no other property outside the jurisdiction; \\nf.I have no other real property abroad; \\ng.I do not receive any rent either directly or through servants or agents; \\nh.I have no share certificates, National Savings Certificates, Unit Trusts, Shares, nor Debentures in any jurisdiction; \\ni.I have no arrears of salary, income, or other debts due; \\nj.There are no trusts of which I am a beneficiary. \\n11.Consequently, the realisable property is inadequate for the payment of the amount remaining to be recovered under the confiscation order.” \\n14.\\nThe application was duly made to Mr Beatson QC for the certificate of inadequacy. The prosecution submitted to the learned Deputy Judge that the application was an abuse of the process because it sought to re-litigate the issue that had been determined by His Honour Judge Rivlin. The Deputy Judge said this: \\n“7.\\nOn behalf of the defendant, Mr Lewis first submits that the issue before me under section 14 is not identical to that determined by His Honour Judge Rivlin. So no question of collateral attack on that decision, ie issue estoppel in the strick sense, applies. He further submits that in the circumstances of this case, in particular fresh evidence which has not been contradicted by evidence on behalf of the prosecution, there is no abuse of process and it is just that I issue a certificate of inadequacy. \\n8.\\nSince the decisions of the House of Lords in Government of the United States of America v Montgomery [2001] 1 WLR 196 and Re Norris [2001] 1 WLR 1388, it is clear that in relation to confiscation orders there is a division of responsibility and function between the Crown Court, which is concerned with what order to make under sections 1 to 4, and the High Court exercising the civil jurisdiction: see Lord Hope at paragraph 3 and 5, and Lord Hobhouse at paragraph 23 of Re Norris. The question for the Crown Court under section 4 was the amount of the value of the defendant's proceeds from drug trafficking or, if the defendant shows that this is the lesser sum, the amount appearing to the court that might be so realised. \\n9.\\nIn the context of section 4(3), on Mr Lewis's submission the Crown Court is looking to the future. The question for the High Court, however, on his submission, is whether the realisable property is in fact inadequate for the payment. Mr Lewis submitted that the function of the High Court is not to revisit the order as a collateral attack on the judge's decision, but to determine whether the assets available to the defendant as a matter of fact are adequate. The classic example of this is where the asset in fact realised less than was assumed by the Crown Court when making the order. So, in his submission, although the issues are related, as was recognised in Re Norris, they are not identical. Moreover, he submits, this is shown by the fact that the receiver as well as the defendant can apply for a certificate of inadequacy. In such a case there can be no question of the matter having been decided against the receiver. \\n10.\\nI accept, given the temporal differences, that the issue under section 14 is not identical to that under section 4 so as to give rise to issue estoppel in the strict sense. Nevertheless, I conclude, for the reasons below, that the present application should be struck out as an abuse of process. The issues which the defendant was seeking to raise were ones which had been adjudicated by His Honour Judge Rivlin and which the defendant had an opportunity to contest and to adduce evidence to satisfy the judge.” \\n15.\\nThen at paragraph 13 he continued: \\n“Mr Lewis submitted that the classic statement of what a defendant must show when applying for a certificate of inadequacy, as set out by Lord Justice Keene in Gokal v Serious Fraud Office, paragraph 24, simply does not apply to hidden assets, Keene LJ stated: \\n'.... it is not enough for a defendant to come to court and say that his assets are inadequate to meet the confiscation order, unless at the same time he condescends to demonstrate what has happened since the making of the order to the realisable property found by the trial jude to have existed when the order was made .... Any other approach would amount to an attempt to go behind the finding embodied in the confiscation order, and such an attempt would be an abuse of process.' \\n14.\\nMr Lewis submits that this cannot be done in the case of hidden assets. All a defendant can do is to give his evidence and point to what the receiver has recovered.” \\n16.\\nAt paragraph 18 of the judgment he said: \\n“Mr Dennison submitted, first, that Re Norris concerned an application by a third party and was primarily concerned with third parties who were not party to the criminal proceedings; that it did not affect the position of a defendant. He pointed to the speech of Lord Hope at paragraph 4, where his Lordship said: \\n'The scheme of the Act, so far as third party interests are concerned ....', \\nand in paragraph 6, where his Lordship stated that: \\n'It cannot be an abuse of process for a third party holding an interest in property .... to seek to exercise that right just because he or she gave evidence in the Crown Court.' \\n19.\\nHe also relied on the speech of Lord Hobhouse, at paragraph 26, in which his Lordship distinguished the position of a person who was trying to re-litigate in a civil court a factual issue which had already been decided against him in a criminal case in which he had been a party, and had a full opportunity of contesting the decision in the court by which it was made with the situation in Re: Norris, where there was a third party. \\n20.\\nSecondly, Mr Dennison relies on the fact that Gokal v Serious Fraud Office was cited by Lord Hobhouse in Re: Norris and must be taken to be approved by it.” \\n17.\\nThe learned judge then proceeded to cite from Lord Hobhouse's opinion. Finally, the Deputy Judge concluded: \\n“24.\\nI accept Mr Dennison's submissions on Re: Norris. So although any indications in the early authorities that the matter is one of strict issue estoppel may not survive that decision, the general approach taken does. Though Mr Lewis submitted that Gokal v Serious Fraud Office had not been approved by their Lordships, it is difficult to read the last sentence of paragraph 26 quoted above otherwise. The recent affidavit evidence does not take things further than they were at the date of the confiscation order. It largely consists of the same evidence as was, or should have been, available at that time and seeks to go behind the confiscation order as to the amounts of the defendant's realisable assets; and in Gokal v Serious Fraud Office Keene LJ stated (at paragraph 17) that this was not a proper basis on which to seek a certificate. As far as the letter from the receiver is concerned, that is simply evidence that he has not recovered the assets, that he has not found the money which the judge found had been salted away abroad. It is not evidence that the realisable property is in fact inadequate. \\n25.\\nWith regard to the submissions that the position differs in the case of assumed hidden assets, I conclude that it does not. In both Gokal v Serious Fraud Office and Ex parte B and in the earlier case of Ex parte Anscombe, the orders were in whole or in part based on such assets. \\n26.\\nWith regard to Mr Lewis's point based on Phillips v the United Kingdom, the fairness of the confiscation order in such a case depends on the precise facts. The policy considerations that weighed with the European Court of Human Rights in Phillips, ie the legitimacy of the aim of preventing criminals profiting from their crime and the fact that the nature and extent of a defendant's assets are peculiarly in his knowledge, and the fact that the inquiry under section 4 and the reverse burden of proof occurs at the sentencing stage after conviction, apply equally in the case of hidden assets. \\n27.\\nFor these reasons I conclude that the application in this case is an abuse of process and I strike it out.” \\n18.\\nThe applicant's grounds of appeal are summarised thus: \\n“Ground 1. The judge having found there was no issue estoppel was wrong to hold that the application was an abuse of process. \\nGround 2. The judge gave insufficient weight to the distinction between the jurisdictions of the High Court in enforcing confiscation orders and the Crown Court in making confiscation orders. \\nGround 3. The judge was wrong not to hold that the Receiver's report constituted fresh evidence.” \\n19.\\nThese grounds are expanded in a skeleton argument which I have considered carefully. In my judgment the Deputy Judge was plainly right for the reasons he gave. This is a clear attempt to re-litigate the making of the confiscation order in the sum of £750,000. I regard the point on the European Convention on Human Rights as bad. The burden of proof is not reversed in relation to estimating the realisable assets. Their Lordships' House in R v Rezvi, in which the opinions were delivered on 24 January 2002, explained that there was no incompatibility between the Convention and the confiscation scheme under the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which is effectively identical to that contained within the drugs legislation.\\n20.\\nThis application is hopeless.

The charge is that Jacob Sigodo Mabonde Moyo made a false statement on his application for registration documents.\\nThe prosecutor applied for an interim direction under paragraph 9(3) of Schedule 5 to the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 prohibiting the person charged and his practice from providing immigration advice and/or services pending the hearing of the charge.\\nI heard this application for an interim direction on Thursday 25th April 2002 at St Albans Crown Court. \\nDavid Barr, of Counsel, appeared for the prosecutor. The person charged appeared in person. \\nI granted the application. I directed that Jacob Sigodo Mabonde Moyo and any person employed by him or working under his supervision be prohibited from providing immigration advice or immigration services from 25th April 2002, until the conclusion of the charge proceedings or further direction. \\nThe hearing of the disciplinary charge.\\nThis took place at 48/49 Chancery Lane on Thursday 15th August 2002.\\nDavid Barr, of Counsel, appeared for the prosecutor. Revantha Amarasinha, solicitor, appeared for the person charged. The person charged was present.\\nMr Amarasinha told the tribunal that the person charged had been refused leave to remain in the United Kingdom. He told us that the person charged cannot lawfully work in the United Kingdom but he believed that he was entitled to work when he signed the declaration. \\nWe adjourned for a short time so that Mr Amarasinha could take further instructions.\\nWhen the tribunal re-assembled, Mr Amarasinha told us that his client admitted the charge as laid and breach of clause 50 a), d) and e) of the Code of Standards. He and his client accepted that the answer “No” to the question “are you subject to any restrictions on your residence in or permission to work in the United Kingdom?” was false and the declaration on page 5 verifying the above answer was incorrect. \\nIn the light of the admission we found the charge proved.\\nWe then rehearsed section 89 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 [flag 18 pages 10 and 11 of 16] and reminded ourselves and the parties present of the available directions.\\nThe prosecutor asked for a direction under section 89(8)(c). \\nWe then asked Mr Amarasinha to mitigate for his client.\\nMr Amarasinha reminded us that the bundle before us included statements by Saiqa Khan [flag 12] and Christopher Salmon [flag 13], which the person charged had received very recently. He said that those statements alleged activity by or on behalf of his client after the making of the interim direction on 25th April and neither he nor his client had had any proper opportunity to investigate those allegations. He asked for an adjournment to allow his client to investigate those matters. The prosecutor said that he wanted those allegations to be before the tribunal as they were or may be relevant when considering any direction. He did not oppose the application for adjournment. \\nWe said that we wished to hear from Mr Moyo before deciding on the application to adjourn.\\nWe told the parties that we proposed to continue the hearing, that we would put out of our minds the allegations that the person charged had caused or allowed others to provide immigration advice and/or services since the prohibition on 25th April.\\nMr Moyo entered the witness box. He was born on 2nd November 1942. He was brought up in Rhodesia. He met and came to know Robert Mugabe. He was detained in Rhodesia. He came to the United Kingdom in 1971. He arrived on a student visa. He was granted indefinite leave to remain after his marriage to a woman who was resident in the United Kingdom. He studied at LSE. He worked for central government, local government and the CRE. In 1982, Robert Mugabe asked him to return to Zimbabwe. He returned with his family. He worked in the Ministry of Land. He fell out with the government. He was moved to the Ministry of Agriculture in 1984. He then went to the Ministry of Justice. He became master of the High Court. He was responsible for deceased persons’ assets and the assets of companies in liquidation. He was frequently asked to approve sales to friends of the government at an undervalue but refused to agree to such action. Matters came to a head when he was asked to appoint a South African citizen liquidator of a company with valuable assets. He discovered that the person did not have a Zimbabwean work permit and therefore refused to appoint him. This led to threatening calls to his home. His wife travelled to England in July 1998 for a wedding. In August 1998, he was visited by employees of the C.I.O who told him that he was to be killed but those in senior positions were divided as to when. He then fled to England with his children, arriving on 26th August 1998. He told an immigration officer on his arrival here that he was coming for a family wedding and was to stay for a month. He did this, as he had not decided whether to stay in the United Kingdom or to travel to Sweden or Canada and remain there. In the event, he decided to stay in England with his family. He needed an income and so he began giving immigration advice to others. He charged those others, as he needed money to support himself and his family.\\nHe explained his application to the Home Office for renewal of indefinite leave to remain and permission to work. It was refused in January 2002.\\nHe told us of the assistance he had received in dealing with the Home office from Jim Dowd MP, from Lord Healey and of his letter to Barbara Roche, when she was Minister of State at the Home Office.\\nHe told us that the letter from Jim Dowd, [flag 15 2nd page] led him to believe that he could continue to provide immigration advice and services and that, maybe, the Home Office had agreed that he should work. He told us that his application to the prosecutor was completed in a hurry, that he had lost the Jim Dowd letter and was relying on memory and he had not deliberately lied when making the declaration that was, in fact, false.\\nHe told us that he had been loyal to the interim direction and had not worked since 25th April.\\nWe then considered the application to adjourn.\\nWe retired and discussed the matter.\\nWe returned. We told the parties that we had taken into account Mr Moyo’s evidence that he had been loyal to my interim direction, but that our provisional view was that the gravity of the charge which we had found proved was so serious that permanent prohibition seemed appropriate. \\nWe refused the application to adjourn.\\nWe asked Mr Amarasinha what else he wished to say.\\nMr Amarasinha summarised his client’s position. Mr Moyo had made an innocent mistake. He had had a nagging doubt about his true position and should have checked his position. He accepted the prosecutor’s case. His failure to do so earlier was because he had not had the benefit of legal advice on his position. He had led an impeccable life. He is a man of high moral standing. He clearly regrets his position. He has children to support. A lesser penalty would be appropriate. He will learn from this experience and will not repeat what occurred. \\nDecision.\\nWe direct that Jacob Sigido Mabonde Moyo be prohibited from providing immigration advice and/or immigration services indefinitely.\\nReasons\\nThe person charged holds himself out as expert in immigration matters including applications for leave to enter or remain and appeals against refusals of leave to enter and remain [flag 3 page 3]. The question on the competence statement [flag 4 page 4] relating to restrictions on residence and permission to work is clear and easily understood. The answer was and is false. The declaration on the document [flag 4 page 5] makes it clear that the preceding statements are important and the answers to them must be true and accurate.\\nWe cannot accept the person charged’s explanation as to how he came to give the false answer and then falsely declare it to be true. The person charged knew that he had been given permission to remain for 6 months when he arrived in the UK in August 1998. He knew this permission was on the express terms that he did not work. He knew that he had applied for leave to remain and that his application had not been determined. He knew that he had no right to reside in the UK and no right to work until granted leave to remain. Any person in the person charged’s position must have known that the answer given was false. Having considered and discussed the evidence before us, we are sure that he did know his answer was false and we are sure that he deliberately made and signed the false declaration. \\nA person who makes such a false declaration on his application to obtain registration is wholly unsuitable for registration as a person providing immigration advice or immigration services under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The offence is so serious that there must be a direction under section 89(8)(c) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. \\nHis Honour Judge Seddon Cripps\\nDated: 20th August 2002.', '2002/1/DIS\\nJacob Sigodo Mabonde Mayo\\nOISC\\nBreach of code of standards\\napplication/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\\n0.27.0\\n39dee3c822c9f7efc3db28669c40d4cca260e12d67518234ebf33fd892f77e4d\\nUKIST\\nIMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM ACT 1999\\nTHE IMMIGRATION SERVICES TRIBUNAL\\nCHARGE NO: IMS/2002/001/DIS\\nBetween:\\nTHE IMMIGRATION SERVICES COMMISSIONER\\nProsecutor\\nand\\nJACOB SIGODO MABONDE MOYO\\nPerson charged\\nBefore:\\nHis Honour Judge Cripps\\nDr Susan Rowlands\\nDr Alan Montgomery CMG\\nSitting at the Immigration Services Tribunal,\\n48/49 Chancery lane \\nLondon WC2A 1JR\\nHearing date: 15th August 2002\\nSent to parties: August 2002\\nDECISION and REASONS [RULE 24]\\nBackground\\nBy letter dated 13th June 2001, Jacob Sigodo Mabonde Moyo, trading as J S M Consultancy Services (JSMCS), the person charged, was notified that the Immigration Services Commissioner, the prosecutor, had approved him for registration. \\nBy letter dated 10th April 2002, the prosecutor laid a disciplinary charge against the person charged.
